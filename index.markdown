**wranÂ·gle**
: (v.) round up, herd, or take charge of (e.g. livestock or just-downloaded data sets)

**_skdata_** is a Python library of standard data sets for machine learning experiments.
The modules of `skdata`
1. **download** data sets,
2. **load** them as directly as possible as Python data structures, and
3. **provide protocols** for machine learning tasks via convenient views.

## Gist

To demonstrate the full system, here's how you would evaluate a Support Vector
Machine (scikit-learn's LinearSVC) as a classification model for the UCI
"Iris" data set:

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Create a suitable view of the Iris data set.</span>
<span class="c"># (For larger data sets, this can trigger a download the first time)</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">skdata.iris.view</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">KfoldClassification</span>
<span class="n">iris_view</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">KfoldClassification</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c"># Create a learning algorithm based on scikit-learn&#39;s LinearSVC</span>
<span class="c"># that will be driven by commands the `iris_view` object.</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">sklearn.svm</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">LinearSVC</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">skdata.base</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">SklearnClassifier</span>
<span class="n">learning_algo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">SklearnClassifier</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">LinearSVC</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c"># Drive the learning algorithm from the data set view object.</span>
<span class="c"># (An iterator interface is sometimes also be available,</span>
<span class="c">#  so you don&#39;t have to give up control flow completely.)</span>
<span class="n">iris_view</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">protocol</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">learning_algo</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c"># The learning algorithm keeps track of what it did when under</span>
<span class="c"># control of the iris_view object. This base example is useful for</span>
<span class="c"># internal testing and demonstration. Use a custom learning algorithm</span>
<span class="c"># to track and save the statistics you need.</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">loss_report</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">algo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">results</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;loss&#39;</span><span class="p">]:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">loss_report</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;task_name&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> \
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;: err = </span><span class="si">%0.3f</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">loss_report</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;err_rate&#39;</span><span class="p">]))</span>
</pre></div>

Note that you can also use the `skdata.iris.dataset` module to get raw
un-standardized access to the Iris data set via Python objects.  This is the
pattern used throughout `skdata`: dataset submodules give raw access,
and view submodules implement standardized views.

## Installation

The recommended installation method is to install via pypi with either
`pip install skdata` or `easy_install skdata` (you probably want to
use `pip` if you have it).

If you want to stay up to date with the development tip then use git:

<div class="highlight"><pre>git clone https://github.com/jaberg/skdata <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="o">(</span> <span class="nb">cd </span>skdata python <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> setup.py develop <span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>


## Goal

The goal with skdata is to standardize the representation
of community benchmark data sets (including large and awkward ones),
and facilitate the development of broadly applicable machine learning algorithm implementations.
Skdata is meant to interoperate with other Python machine learning software
such as
[sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).


## Status

The code of the library is currently usable (and frequently used), but the API
should be considered to be unstable.

The data set modules are not currently implemented in a standard way, but they
are being re-factored to match the "View API"
([docs](https://github.com/jaberg/skdata/wiki/View-API),
[code](https://github.com/jaberg/skdata/blob/master/skdata/base.py)),
and [add more data set modules](https://github.com/jaberg/skdata/wiki/How-to-Create-a-New-Dataset-Module).
